visualizations that can improve the comprehension of the data. For this notebook most of the data cleaning is already done and it mostly
focuses on the data visualization. This file is accredited to Jaime Guzman.

## Google News Sentiment Analysis

use a vpn to be able to scrape the internet on different countries.

In this folder you can find different files pertaining mainly to the networks. This folder is accredited to Magnus BÃ¸je Madsen. In it the 
following files are found:

### TF IDF

In this notebook we do all the different tests with our data and generate wordclouds, as well as different metrics such as assortivity.

### Network Analysis

We can find all the work done in network analysis on this file. This file also contains the division into different sections of the network and the final
findings on the influence each politician has.

### Wikidata Retrieval

This file is similar to New test as it shows how we obtain the data from the internet for all the articles on each of our politicians, but it's only the data from wikipedia.
